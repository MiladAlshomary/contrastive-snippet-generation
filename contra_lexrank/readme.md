## Fine-tuning

In order to optimize the parameters $ d_1, d_2 $ and $d_3$, adapt the paths in `contra-lexrank.py` 
to your environment. Subsequently, run its `main` function.

## Testing

To obtain final performance scores on your model (i.e.,
hyper-parameter combination), set your values in `contra-lexrank-test.py` and run
its `main` function.
