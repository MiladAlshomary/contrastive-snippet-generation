# Contrastive Snippet generation

Here, we provide the data and implementation of the approaches to generate contrastive snippets.

* `bert-finetuning` contains code for the training and testing of the argument quality
transformer.

* `contra_lexrank` contains the implementation of our graph-based approach.

* `comp_summarizer` contains the derivative of the comparative summarization approach.

* `data` contains our argument corpora, except the data used fhe regression transformer

* `shared` contains utility code.

Further details on the intended execution, can be found in the corresponding module directories.
